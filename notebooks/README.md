```bash
# Essential dependencies
pip install numpy matplotlib

# Optional but recommended for 3D visualization
pip install open3d

# Optional for advanced analysis
pip install scipy scikit-learn
```

### Running the Tutorials

1. **Start Jupyter**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   # or
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. **Navigate** to the notebooks folder

3. **Open a tutorial** and follow along step-by-step

4. **Modify the device IP** in the connection cells to match your Aurora device

### Device Configuration

Before running the tutorials, ensure your Aurora device is:

- **Powered on** and fully initialized
- **Connected to the same network** as your computer
- **Not being used** by other applications
- **In the correct mode** for the features you want to test

## üìñ Tutorial Learning Path

### Beginner Path
1. Start with **Getting Started** to understand the basics
2. Try **Camera and Images** to see visual data
3. Explore **VSLAM Mapping** for 3D understanding

### Advanced Path
1. Complete the beginner path first
2. Dive into **Enhanced Imaging** for AI-powered computer vision
3. Master **Advanced Enhanced Imaging** for complex workflows
4. Explore **2D LiDAR Mapping** for navigation applications

## üîß Customization

Each notebook is designed to be:

- **Self-contained**: Can be run independently
- **Modifiable**: Easy to adapt for your specific needs
- **Well-documented**: Extensive comments and explanations
- **Interactive**: Encourages experimentation

### Adapting for Your Use Case

```python
# Example: Modify connection parameters
device_ip = "YOUR_DEVICE_IP_HERE"  # Change this

# Example: Adjust processing parameters
max_points = 4096  # Reduce for faster processing
update_rate = 10   # Hz, adjust based on your needs

# Example: Enable/disable visualizations
SHOW_PLOTS = True  # Set to False for headless operation
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

### Recommended Setup

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv aurora_tutorials
source aurora_tutorials/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
aurora_tutorials\Scripts\activate     # Windows

2. Open the notebooks folder in VS Code
3. Select your Python interpreter with Aurora SDK
4. Run cells interactively

## üìä Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Problems:**
```python
# Check device IP and network
ping 192.168.1.212

# Verify Aurora SDK installation
import slamtec_aurora_sdk
print("SDK imported successfully")
```

**Visualization Issues:**
```python
# For Jupyter display problems
%matplotlib inline

# For Open3D in remote environments
# Use headless mode and save point clouds to files
```

**Performance Issues:**
```python
# Reduce point cloud size
scan_data = sdk.get_recent_lidar_scan(max_points=2048)

# Lower update rates
time.sleep(0.2)  # 5Hz instead of 10Hz
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Your Aurora SDK code here
```
